Use it when your code may present alerts in rapid succession, to ensure all alerts will be presented.\r\n\r\nUsing QueuedAlertPresenter instead of UIAlertController directly, ensures your user gets to see all the alerts your code creates.\r\n\r\nTo present an alert create an instance of AlertInfo then add it to the sharedAlertPresenter with addAlert(alertInfo).\r\nAlertInfo holds the information for an individual alert you want to present.\r\n\r\n![Demo app](https://sintraworks.github.io/QueuedAlertPresenter/Images/QueuedAlertPresenter!.png)\r\n![Sample Alert](https://sintraworks.github.io/QueuedAlertPresenter/Images/QueuedAlertPresenter!.png)\r\n\r\nQueuedAlertPresenter is written in **Swift**.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n====\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nfunc showAlert() {\r\n    let action = AlertAction(title: \"Hit me\", style: .Default, enabled: true, isPreferredAction: true, handler: nil)\r\n    let alertInfo = AlertInfo(title: \"Success\", message: \"Hey, this is alert nÂº \\(i)\", actions: [action])\r\n    QueuedAlertPresenter.sharedAlertPresenter.addAlert(alertInfo)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Requirements\r\n\r\n| Compile Time  | Runtime       |\r\n| :------------ | :------------ |\r\n| Xcode 7       | iOS 8         |\r\n| iOS 9 SDK     |               \r\n\r\n## License (MIT License)\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Antonio Nunes\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
