QueuedAlertPresenter
====

A QueuedAlertPresenter serializes the presentation of alerts. Use it when your code may present alerts in rapid succession, to ensure all alerts will be presented.

Using QueuedAlertPresenter instead of UIAlertController directly, ensures your user gets to see all the alerts your code creates.

To present an alert create an instance of AlertInfo then add it to the sharedAlertPresenter with addAlert(alertInfo).
AlertInfo holds the information for an individual alert you want to present.

QueuedAlertPresenter is written in **Swift**.

Usage
====

```swift
func showAlert() {
    let action = AlertAction(title: "Hit me", style: .Default, enabled: true, isPreferredAction: true, handler: nil)
    let alertInfo = AlertInfo(title: "Success", message: "Hey, this is alert nÂº \(i)", actions: [action])
    QueuedAlertPresenter.sharedAlertPresenter.addAlert(alertInfo)
}
```

You can call addAlert() from any thread. See scheduleAlertsMultiThreaded() in ViewController.swift for an example.
